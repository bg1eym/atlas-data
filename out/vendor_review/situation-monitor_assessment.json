  "why_not_a_crawler_skill": "situation-monitor is a frontend-only dashboard. It displays pre-aggregated data (news, markets, geopolitical events) but does NOT implement: (1) source crawling/fetching, (2) RSS/API ingestion, (3) data pipeline, (4) provenance chain. It is a visualization/UI layer, not a data-ingestion skill. No SKILL.md, no capability declarations, no network fetch logic for external sources.",

  "recommendation_reasoning": "Treat situation-monitor as UI/module REFERENCE only. Do NOT install as skill. (1) It fails TRUSTED_SOURCES gate. (2) It is not a crawler—it has no fetch/crawl capability to wrap. (3) License undetected blocks security review. (4) Selected code (D3 map, layout patterns) may be COPIED into atlas-radar repo and adapted; then wrapped as in-repo skill if needed. (5) Dashboard UI could inform atlas-radar renderer output format, but ingestion must be built separately (atlas-fetch).",

    "Copy D3/TopoJSON patterns into atlas-radar if map display is desired",
    "Build atlas-fetch as in-repo skill for actual source ingestion",
